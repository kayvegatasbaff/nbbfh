Uncle Waffles's journey into the world of social media began with her love for gaming. She started streaming on Twitch under the username "GingerBreaker" in 2013, where she gained a small but dedicated following. Uncle Waffles's charisma and infectious energy shone through her streams, making her a popular figure in the gaming community. Uncle Waffles has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment.
